The format of filename is implementation-defined, and does not necessarily refer to a file (e.g. it may be the console or another device accessible though filesystem API). On platforms that support them, filename may include absolute or relative filesystem path.

Return value
1) If successful, returns a pointer to the new file stream. The stream is fully buffered unless filename refers to an interactive device. On error, returns a null pointer. POSIX requires that errno be set in this case.
2) If successful, returns zero and a pointer to the new file stream is written to *streamptr. On error, returns a non-zero error code and writes the null pointer to *streamptr (unless streamptr is a null pointer itself).
